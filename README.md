# Factorio Init Script
A simple factorio init script for linux

# Debugging
 If you find yourself wondering why stuff is not working the way you expect:
 - Check the logs, I suggest you `tail -f /opt/factorio/factorio-current.log` in a separate session
 - Enable debugging in the config and/or:
 - Try running the same commands as the factorio user (`/opt/factorio-init/factorio invocation` will tell you what the factorio user tries to run at start)

 ```bash
 $ /opt/factorio-init/factorio invocation
 #  Run this as the factorio user, example:
 $ sudo -u factorio 'whatever invocation gave you'
 # You should see some output in your terminal here, hopefully giving
 # you a hint of what is going wrong
 ```

# Install
- Create a directory where you want to store this script along with configuration. (either copy-paste the files or clone from github):

 ```bash
 $ cd '/opt'
 $ git clone https://github.com/Bisa/factorio-init.git
 ```
- Rename config.example to config and modify the values within according to your setup.

## Autocompletion
- Copy/Symlink or source the bash_autocompletion file

 ```bash
 $ ln -s /opt/factorio-init/bash_autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/factorio
 # OR:
 $ echo "source /opt/factorio-init/bash_autocomplete" >> ~/.bashrc
 # restart your shell to verify that it worked
 ```

## Systemd
- Copy the example service, adjust & reload

 ```bash
 $ cp /opt/factorio-init/factorio.service.example /etc/systemd/system/factorio.service
 # Edit the service file to suit your environment then reload systemd
 $ systemctl daemon-reload
 ```

- Verify that the server starts

 ```bash
 $ systemctl start factorio
 $ systemctl status -l factorio
 # Remember to enable the service at startup if you want that:
 $ systemctl enable factorio
 ```

## SysvInit
- Symlink the init script:

 ```bash
 $ ln -s /opt/factorio-init/factorio /etc/init.d/factorio
 # Make the script executable:
 $ chmod +x /opt/factorio-init/factorio
 # Try it out:
 $ service factorio help
 # Do not forget to enable the service at boot if you want that.
 ```
